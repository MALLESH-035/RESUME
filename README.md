## 🧠 Engineering Mindset

Coming from Mechanical Engineering, I naturally think in systems.

Whether it's a machine or a backend architecture:
- Every component must serve a purpose
- Efficiency matters
- Structure defines strength
- Optimization is continuous

Now I apply that same mindset to building software.

## 🚀 Experience & Exposure

- Participated in multiple hackathons where I built and shipped working prototypes under time pressure  
- Strong understanding of backend fundamentals — APIs, routing, request/response cycle, databases, authentication  
- Built and deployed websites using clean HTML & CSS  
- Explored full-stack architecture and real-world project structuring  

I don’t just write code — I design flow.

## 🌟 Featured Project — Impact Loop

**Impact Loop** is a smart feedback and improvement tracking platform designed to convert user input into structured action.

Instead of letting feedback get lost, the system:

- Collects structured responses  
- Stores and categorizes them in a database  
- Tracks their status (Pending → In Progress → Completed)  
- Creates a loop of continuous improvement  

The idea is simple:
Feedback should not end as text — it should become measurable impact.

Through this project, I strengthened:
- Backend logic structuring  
- Database schema design  
- API integration  
- Full-stack flow understanding
